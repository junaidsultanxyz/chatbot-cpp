[2026-02-03 00:34:46] bot: Pipes are a method of inter-process communication (IPC) that allow data to flow from one process to another. The pipe() system call creates a unidirectional communication channel where one process writes to the pipe and another reads from it.

[2026-02-03 00:36:06] bot: The exec family of functions replaces the current process image with a new program. Common variants include: execl(), execv(), execle(), execve(), execlp(), execvp(). They differ in how arguments are passed (list vs array) and whether they use PATH or environment variables. After exec, the new program runs in the same process ID.

[2026-02-03 00:36:21] bot: Multithreading is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space, making communication between them faster than inter-process communication.
